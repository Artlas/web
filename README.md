### Project Description

The Artlas project takes the form of a social network. This social network is presented through a fully responsive website. It is a platform where numerous works of art are offered and where users have the possibility to (re)discover them and to interact with the artists. The platform is also a place where artists can share their works and sell them. The platform is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to all, regardless of their location or familiarity with technology.

#### Project Definition

Artlas allows users to register and share a variety of artistic works, including painting, sculpture, drawing, engraving, and photography. Artists not only have the possibility to post their creations, but also to sell them by setting their own price. Artlas stands out for its ability to accommodate all formats of artwork, unlike other platforms that impose format restrictions.

2. **Social Sustainability:**
    - **Community Building:** Artlas can contribute to strengthening social bonds by connecting people with common artistic interests and creating communities around shared passions.
    - **Support for Emerging Artists:** By providing a platform for lesser-known or emerging artists, Artlas contributes to their professional and personal development.
3. **Economic Sustainability:**
    - **Creating New Economic Opportunities:** By enabling artists to sell their artworks directly through the platform, Artlas opens up new economic avenues for creators of all kinds.
4. **Technological Sustainability:**
    - **Adaptability and Scalability:** The platform must remain adaptable and scalable to incorporate new technologies and trends, ensuring its long-term relevance and sustainability. It will adapt to the works posted by the creators.
5. **Environmental Impact:**

In summary, Artlas has the potential to create a sustainable and positive impact on the art world by promoting cultural diversity, supporting the economic development of artists, strengthening social bonds, and adopting environmentally-friendly practices.

## Design

### Proposed Solution

The project is characterized by a **web application** developed with **React.js** and **Next.js**. The web application is accompanied by an **API** developed with **Node.js** and **Express.js**. The database used is **MongoDB**. Images are stored on an object storage service in a **Minio** bucket.

The web application is fully responsive and allows for easy navigation between different pages. It aims to provide a smooth and intuitive user experience, similar to popular social networks. Users can create an account, log in, access an art feed, like artwork, comment on artwork, share artwork, go to the artwork page, access an artist's page, follow an artist, save artwork to a list, and create a virtual gallery.

### Architecture

The **web application** and the **API** are two separate applications. The **API** is deployed on a dedicated server as a Docker container. The web application is also deployed in another container. The **API** can be accessed at the following address: <https://api.fournierfamily.ovh/>. The web application can be accessed at the following address: <https://fournierfamily.ovh/>.

The **web application** communicates with the **API** via **HTTP requests** whenever it needs an element. The **API** is secured with a **JWT token** system. The **API** then communicates with the **MongoDB** database to retrieve the necessary information. Images are stored on an object storage service in a **Minio** bucket.

CI/CD is managed by **GitHub Actions**. When a **push** is made to the **main** branch, tests are run. If the tests pass, the application is deployed to the production server. A staging server is also available to test new features before deploying them to the production server.
